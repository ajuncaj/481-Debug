# Mutate
2 Projects given out by EECS 481 @ UofM  
"Mutate" uses the native python AST module along with ASTOR to create a number of "mutant" programs. These mutants, near copies of the original aside from small swaps or replacements, can be used against your test cases to verify that they are finding bugs.  
"Delta Debugger" is a program that can find subsets of "interesting" things based on a program supplied to it. This allows for (simple) delta debugging, an automated process of program debugging.
